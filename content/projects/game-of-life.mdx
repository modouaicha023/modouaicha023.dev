**Game of Life** is a simulation project based on the famous **cellular automaton** devised by British mathematician **John Horton Conway** in 1970.

The game demonstrates how complex patterns and behaviors can emerge from simple rules on a grid of cells. This version was built using pure **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It features a dynamic board that evolves generation after generation based on initial conditions set by the user.
